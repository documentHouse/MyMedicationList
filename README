My Medication List is an application for iphone users produced by the national institute of health to allow users to manage their medications in intelligent ways. Future expansions will hopefully include the ability to exchange their medicaiton data with a health care professional safely and securely.
Other mobile platforms with differing native capabilities will be investigated in the future with an eye toward expanding the functionality of MyMedicationList to include features such as automatic file exchange with a health care professional through a hands off bluetooth session. Spurious change.
